== 1 Introduction
MediBook v1.4 is an application that functions as an advanced logbook for use in the healthcare industry. It allows healthcare professionals to keep track and sort patients’ details, arrange their schedule based on their patients’ appointments.


This Developer Guide is intended for users with basic technical background as it details the setting up of our application, the design of our software architecture, describe the implementation of our key features, and the testing involved in our software. Appendix includes user stories and use cases for reference.


== 2 Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== 4. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::statecontrol[]
=== 4.1  State control (undo/redo)
The state control feature allows the user to manipulate the different states of the MediBook in the current session with the undo and redo command. This section will describe the implementation of this feature.

==== 4.1.1  Current implementation

The state control mechanism is managed by the CommandStack class. It supports the undo-ing and redo-ing of commands that modifies the contents of the MediBook in the current session.

These commands will extend from `UndoAbleCommand` instead of `Command`. These commands are then managed by the *undoStack* and the *redoStack*.
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::UndoAbleCommand.png[]

Commands that inherits from `Command` are implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class FindCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        //Find Logic
    }
    //...more code...
}
----

On the other hand, commands that inherit from UndoAbleCommand are implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class ClearCommand extends UndoAbleCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        //Clear Logic
    }

    @Override
    public void executeUndo() {
        //Logic to undo clear
    }

    @Override
    public void executeRedo() {
        //Logic to redo clear
    }
    //...more code...
}
----
As shown, the commands that extends from the UndoAbleCommand will need to know how to undo and redo the changes they have made. This requires the object to store information of the change made. For example the DeleteCommand object will need store the person that was deleted so that the change made can be undone.

*The following core methods are in place to assist the mechanism:*

* `*undoLast()*`- Undo the command at the top of the *undoStack* and push it to the *redoStack* +
* `*redoLast()*`- Redo the command at the top of the *redoStack* and push it to the *undoStack* +
* `*truncateOldPath()*`- Clears the *redoStack* following a change made after undo-ing. +
* `*addCommandToStack()*`- Push an UndoAbleCommand into the command stack +
* `*checkForAction()*`- Check whether the `truncateOldPath()` method needs to be called before calling `addCommandToStack()`. +

*Below is an example usage scenario and the behaviours of the component at a given time:*

*1. On start-up:*

CommandStack will be initialised with an empty `undoStack` and `redoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple1.jpg[]

*2. User executes a command that make changes to the MediBook (e.g add John Doe...):*

The `add` command will do a`*commandStack.checkForAction()*` and subsequently `*addCommandToStack()*` which adds the AddCommand object into the `undoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple2.png[]

[NOTE]
`*commandStack.checkForAction()*` will only be called if the command has been executed successfully. If it fails its execution, the object will not be pushed into the `undoStack`.

*3. User executes another command that make changes to the MediBook (e.g delete 1):*

The same procedures as step 2 applies and the new `DeleteCommand` will be pushed into the `undoStack` on top of the previous `AddCommand` object.

image::statecontrolimple3.png[]

*4. User wants to undo the change they just made and executes the `undo` command:*

The undo command calls `*commandHistory.undoLast()*` which will get the object at the top of the `undoStack`, call its `executeUndo()` method, push it into the `redoStack` and then remove it from the undoStack.

image::statecontrolimple4.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user execute `undo` command when the `undoStack` is empty, the `*undoLast()*` method will throw a `*HistoryOutOfBoundException()*` which will be caught in the UndoCommand class and will display an error to the user instead.

*5. User executes another command that make changes to the MediBook after the undo (e.g clear):*

The `clear` command calls `*commandStack.checkForAction()*` which determines that this command was made following an `undo` command and therefore requires `*truncateOldPath()*` to be called. In this case, the `redoStack` will be cleared before the ClearCommand object is pushed into the `undoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple5.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works after the command is parsed:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== 4.1.1  Current implementation
Current implementation requires each UndoAbleCommand object to know how to revert their own changes.This will use less memory as minimal data is stored. For example, for `add`, only the person added will be saved. However, we must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

==== 4.1.3  Alternative consideration
An alternative to the current implementation is to save the different states of the MediBook after each command and iterate through them whenever undo/redo is called. Though this is far less challenging than the current implementation, performance issues might arise due to the high memory usage required.

// end::statecontrol[]

// tag::loginaccess[]
=== 4.2 Login System and Access Level
Securely logs user on to MediBook with a preassigned access level.

=== 4.2.1 Current Implementation
Login is implemented as a User Interface(UI) before the main Graphic UI(GUI) launches. The login UI and main GUI are two different scenes. Upon the launch of MediBook, the scene is set to the login UI and MediBook prompts for two input from the User, username and password. MediBook then compares the given pair of inputs with the data in the file loginstorage.txt.
On successful login, the scene will switch from login UI to the main GUI scene.

image::sceneswitch.png[]

Similar to the main GUI, login UI uses JavaFX with the file, signin.fxml, and its controller class, LoginWindow. LoginWindow class handles the getting of user inputs (i.e. Username and Password).
Additionally, LoginWindow will reject empty fields and prompt the user for non-empty inputs. These are implemented with the function tryLogin().
If valid inputs are entered by the user, LoginWindow will send the inputs to the Login component of Medibook. The Login component will return an answer in the form of a Boolean as to whether login is successful or not.
The user has three tries to enter a correct set of username and password before the program exits for security reasons.

When Login component receives the input from LoginWindow, a Credentials class object with the given username and password will be instantiated in Login class.
Using the methods of the Credentials class, validation of the Credentials will take place. The Credentials are passed through the WorkWithLoginStorage class which will retrieve data from loginstorage.txt and comapre it with the input.
loginstorage.txt stores the username of all users and the hashes of their passwords and their respective access levels.
WorkWithLoginStorage class iterates through loginstorage.txt to find the matching username, and the corresponding hashed password. The password input is then hashed using Java’s SHA-512 hashing algorithm and the result is compared with the hashed password stored in loginstorage.txt.
If both matches then a Boolean true will be returned and a Boolean false if otherwise.

=== 4.2.2 Reason for Implementation
A different UI scene is used for login so as to allow main GUI to be more isolated. Should the User fail to log in, access to Medibook must and will be denied. Thus login is implemented before the main GUI.
As login UI and main GUI will never need to be concurrent, two separate scenes and switching from login UI to main GUI can be used.

To ensure a secure MediBook, user login profiles must be stored securely. Storing the hash result instead of the password ensures that should loginstorage.txt be compromised, the actual passwords are still unknown to the perpetrators.
This is due to hashes being one-way. It is almost impossible for people to get back the actual password with a hash. Also, two similar passwords (e.g. Password123! and Password124!) will result in a completely different hash making it even harder for hackers to work out the actual password based on the hashes.


=== 4.2.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
An alternative implementation, Java Authentication and Authorisation System (JAAS), was also considered when deciding on how to implement MediBook’s login system. However, using JAAS is more restrictive than the current implementation which allows for easy change in hashing algorithms used and different security features in the future. JAAS is also harder to implement and as MediBook is currently targeted at about 1000 users, there is no need to use JAAS.
In the future, a salt will be used to safeguard against rainbow table attacks where hackers compare the hashes from loginstorage.txt with their own table of hashes of all different combinations of passwords.
// end::loginaccess[]

=== 4.3 Scheduling
Scheduling allows appointment to be stored in MediBook. MediBook recognises a schedule date with the tag 'd/'.

==== 4.3.1 Current Implementation
The schedule feature currently accepts dates from the users as an input category under the add command. Input must be in the format DD-MM-YYYY for it to be accepted as a proper schedule date input. For each person added, multiple schedule dates can be added and it is also not a compulsory field to fill.

This is achieved by setting up a schedule class which sets a regular expression (regex) that only accept valid dates in the DD-MM-YYYY format. Non-existent dates such as 30-02-2019 or 28-28-2019 would not be accepted.

Subsequently, a hashset of schedule act as an attribute for person class. Every time the add command is used to add a valid person, a person object is created with the set of schedule as part of the attribute of the person. As such, there can be multiple appointment dates added together with the person. The schedule is identified using the ‘d/’ mark.

==== 4.3.2 Reason for Implementation
Due to the large number of patients the doctors care for, it is at times hard to keep track of the numerous appointments made by their patients. As such, a scheduling feature would record the appointment date so that they can keep track of the numerous appointments they have for the day.

==== 4.3.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
In future versions, the following details would be slowly incremented to ensure a smooth user experience while using the scheduling feature of MediBook.

. Edit the appointment dates only.
. A command to view all or list the appointments in a chronological order following the reference date.
. A doctor can view their respective patients appointment

=== 4.4 Data Organisation
Sorts entries in MediBook according to alphabetical order

=== 4.4.1 Current Implementation
When the sort command is entered, the integrated sort function is called on the list of persons from UniquePersonList, using alphabetical order as the comparator.

The sort command does not access the stored data directly.

=== 4.4.2 Reason for Implementation
The sort feature provides an avenue for users to view their MediBook entries in an organised manner and allows them to find their patient/colleague in a shorter time should they ever forget their name entirely (hence be unable to use the find feature).

=== 4.4.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
In the future, the sort feature can be further enhanced in the following ways.

. Sort according to appointment date with earliest appointment first



== 5.Testing
Testing MediBook is important as it verifies that MediBook is functioning and up-to-date. This can be done so by going into IntelliJ, right-click on the test folder and choose Run 'All Tests'.
