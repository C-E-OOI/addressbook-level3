== 1 Introduction
MediBook v1.4 is an application that functions as an advanced logbook for use in the healthcare industry. It allows healthcare professionals to keep track and sort patients’ details, arrange their schedule based on their patients’ appointments.


This Developer Guide is intended for users with basic technical background as it details the setting up of our application, the design of our software architecture, describe the implementation of our key features, and the testing involved in our software. Appendix includes user stories and use cases for reference.


== 2 Setting up

=== Prerequisites

== 4. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::statecontrol[]

=== 4.1  State control (undo/redo)
The state control feature allows the user to manipulate the different states of the MediBook in the current session with the undo and redo command. This section will describe the implementation of this feature.

==== 4.1.1  Current implementation

The state control mechanism is managed by the CommandStack class. It supports the undo-ing and redo-ing of commands that modifies the contents of the MediBook in the current session.

These commands will extend from `UndoAbleCommand` instead of `Command`. These commands are then managed by the *undoStack* and the *redoStack*.
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::UndoAbleCommand.png[]

Commands that inherits from `Command` are implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class FindCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        //Find Logic
    }
    //...more code...
}
----

On the other hand, commands that inherit from UndoAbleCommand are implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class ClearCommand extends UndoAbleCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        //Clear Logic
    }

    @Override
    public void executeUndo() {
        //Logic to undo clear
    }

    @Override
    public void executeRedo() {
        //Logic to redo clear
    }
    //...more code...
}
----
As shown, the commands that extends from the UndoAbleCommand will need to know how to undo and redo the changes they have made. This requires the object to store information of the change made. For example the DeleteCommand object will need store the person that was deleted so that the change made can be undone.

*Below is an example usage scenario and the behaviours of the component at a given time:*

*1. On start-up:*

CommandStack will be initialised with an empty `undoStack` and `redoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple1.jpg[]

*2. User executes a command that make changes to the MediBook (e.g add John Doe...):*

The `add` command will do a`*commandStack.checkForAction()*` and subsequently `*addCommandToStack()*` which adds the AddCommand object into the `undoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple2.png[]

[NOTE]
`*commandStack.checkForAction()*` will only be called if the command has been executed successfully. If it fails its execution, the object will not be pushed into the `undoStack`.

*3. User executes another command that make changes to the MediBook (e.g delete 1):*

The same procedures as step 2 applies and the new `DeleteCommand` will be pushed into the `undoStack` on top of the previous `AddCommand` object.

image::statecontrolimple3.png[]

*4. User wants to undo the change they just made and executes the `undo` command:*

The undo command calls `*commandHistory.undoLast()*` which will get the object at the top of the `undoStack`, call its `executeUndo()` method, push it into the `redoStack` and then remove it from the undoStack.

image::statecontrolimple4.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user execute `undo` command when the `undoStack` is empty, the `*undoLast()*` method will throw a `*HistoryOutOfBoundException()*` which will be caught in the UndoCommand class and will display an error to the user instead.

*5. User executes another command that make changes to the MediBook after the undo (e.g clear):*

The `clear` command calls `*commandStack.checkForAction()*` which determines that this command was made following an `undo` command and therefore requires `*truncateOldPath()*` to be called. In this case, the `redoStack` will be cleared before the ClearCommand object is pushed into the `undoStack`.

image::statecontrolimple5.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works after the command is parsed:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== 4.1.2  Reason for this implementation
Current implementation requires each UndoAbleCommand object to know how to revert their own changes.This will use less memory as minimal data is stored. For example, for `add`, only the person added will be saved. However, we must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

==== 4.1.3  Alternative consideration
An alternative to the current implementation is to save the different states of the MediBook after each command and iterate through them whenever undo/redo is called. Though this is far less challenging than the current implementation, performance issues might arise due to the high memory usage required.

// end::statecontrol[]
=== 4.2 Login System
Securely logs user on to MediBook

==== 4.2.1 Current Implementation
Login is implemented before the main GUI launches. Upon the launch of MediBook, MediBook prompts for two input from the User, username and password. MediBook then compares the given pair of inputs with loginstorage.txt.

loginstorage.txt stores the username of all users and the hashes of their passwords. MediBook iterates through loginstorage.txt to find the matching username, and the corresponding hashed password. The password entered is hashed using Java’s SHA-512 hashing algorithm. The result is then matched with the hash stored in loginstorage.txt, if both matches then login is successful and user is allowed into MediBook. If they do not match, then the program is terminated.

==== 4.2.2 Reason for this implementation
There is no need to open the GUI, if User fails to log in, thus login is implemented before the GUI launches.
To ensure a secure MediBook, user login profiles must be stored securely. Storing the hash result instead of the password ensures that should loginstorage.txt be compromised, the actual passwords are still unknown to the perpetrators.

==== 4.2.3 Alternative consideration
Java Authentication and Authorisation System (JAAS) was also considered when deciding on how to implement MediBook’s login system. However, using JAAS is more restrictive than the current implementation which allows for easy change in hashing algorithms used and different security features in the future. JAAS is also harder to implement and as MediBook is currently targeted at about 1000 users, there is no need to use JAAS.


=== 4.3 Scheduling
Scheduling allows appointment to be stored in MediBook. MediBook recognises a schedule date with the tag 'd/'.

==== 4.3.1 Current Implementation
The schedule feature currently accepts dates from the users as an input category under the add command. Input must be in the format DD-MM-YYYY for it to be accepted as a proper schedule date input. For each person added, multiple schedule dates can be added and it is also not a compulsory field to fill.

This is achieved by setting up a schedule class which sets a regular expression (regex) that only accept valid dates in the DD-MM-YYYY format. Non-existent dates such as 30-02-2019 or 28-28-2019 would not be accepted.

Subsequently, a hashset of schedule act as an attribute for person class. Every time the add command is used to add a valid person, a person object is created with the set of schedule as part of the attribute of the person. As such, there can be multiple appointment dates added together with the person. The schedule is identified using the ‘d/’ mark.

==== 4.3.2 Reason for Implementation
Due to the large number of patients the doctors care for, it is at times hard to keep track of the numerous appointments made by their patients. As such, a scheduling feature would record the appointment date so that they can keep track of the numerous appointments they have for the day.

==== 4.3.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
In future versions, the following details would be slowly incremented to ensure a smooth user experience while using the scheduling feature of MediBook.

. Edit the appointment dates only.
. A command to view all or list the appointments in a chronological order following the reference date.
. A doctor can view their respective patients appointment

=== 4.4 Data Organisation
Sorts entries in MediBook according to alphabetical order

==== 4.4.1 Current Implementation
When the sort command is entered, the integrated sort function is called on the list of persons from UniquePersonList, using alphabetical order as the comparator.

The sort command does not access the stored data directly.

==== 4.4.2 Reason for Implementation
The sort feature provides an avenue for users to view their MediBook entries in an organised manner and allows them to find their patient/colleague in a shorter time should they ever forget their name entirely (hence be unable to use the find feature).

==== 4.4.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
In the future, the sort feature can be further enhanced in the following ways.

. Sort according to appointment date with earliest appointment first

// tag::associate[]
=== 4.5 Association
The association feature allows users to associate a doctor together with a patient via the link and unlink command, as well as view the persons who are associated via the associatelist command. This segment will elaborate on the implementation of this feature.

==== 4.5.1 Current Implementation
The association feature is implemented as a Set of `Associated` objects. The associated object will hold a String which contains the name and nric of the person that is associated.

==== 4.5.2 Reason for Implementation
This implementation is basically storing a String of an associated person's name and their nric into a set, which is simple to implement. However, since this implementation only stores a set of string, theres is nothing much you can do with it other than viewing it.

==== 4.5.3 Alternative Implementation
An alternative implementation is to store the associated person object instead of just a String of their name and nric. This allows us to directly interact with the list generated by `associatelist` like how the we interact with `list` and `find`. However, this requires saving/loading the persn object to/from a String since the data is stored in addressbook.txt, which can be rather challenging.
// end::associate[]

== 5.Testing
Testing MediBook is important as it verifies that MediBook is functioning and up-to-date. This can be done so by going into IntelliJ, right-click on the test folder and choose Run 'All Tests'.
